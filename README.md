# Chatters
This is a chatroom based website where users can chat with eachother. Currently it uses express and socket.io

## About

This website is a place where people can enter a room and chat with eachother. As it stands right now, the website just runs on a local host. Hopefully in the future, the website will have chatrooms that people can enter

## How it works

Chatters uses socket.io which is a library that creates communication between a client and a server.


In order to create this website, I utilized a few online tutorials. You can see them here:
